# The Countdown app

Application that displays a countdown to a given date. It comes with a plethora of features such as custom date entries, theming etc.
Oh and not forgetting the beloved dark mode! <br>
Just save the date and let the countdown begin!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/be93b718-a6df-402a-b4a4-855ba186c97d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kubernetes-io-main-staging/deploys)

App deployed on netlify at https://rcountdown.netlify.app/

Built with:
Javascript, CSS, html
<br><br>


## Running the application in development on your device- For developers

### Prerequisites
To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

npm comes installed with Node so most likely you don't need to install it separately.

- Clone the repository using 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RDjarbeng/countdown.git
cd countdown
```
- Install dependencies, we used vite for bundling as a dev dependency
```
npm install
```
- View the application using vite by launching the dev server with
```
npm run dev
```

- Or alternatively use live server extension in vscode to view the application. NB: Vite is recommended because you might run into some minor issues with live server in vscode

### Building for production or deployment
Use
```
npm run build
```
This will create a build directory `/dist` with the bundled assets and pages as a Progressive Web App (PWA). You could open the index.html file generated with this build from your file explorer but a better option is to run:

```
npm run preview
```
This provides a link to the built website with the PWA ready to go, useful for testing the build. Before deploying
note that after building some assets such as css, js may have a hash/string of characters added to their name.
It's vite's way of keeping track of files,the application will be able to find those files referenced even with the strange names.

If you make changes that involve addition of new pages or routes you have to update the vite.config.js to ensure the new page is included in the bundling.
Sigh!ðŸ˜ª. But on the bright side it takes care of the PWA configuration and allowing the users to updating the application with the new version.
## Code structure
There are 4 pages currently. 
1. The homepage: with the large countdown:  index.html
2. List page which shows the list of countdowns: countdown-list.html
3. Today page which shows the day counter: today.html
4. About page which shows information about the application version and contributors, about.html

The image below helps to get a high level overview of the code structure

Other utility functions that are used across the application and are not specific to a single page are shown here.

### Possible contributions
Here are possible initial contributions, you can also look through the open [issues](https://github.com/RDjarbeng/countdown/issues) for ideas as well as the tasks in [projects](https://github.com/users/RDjarbeng/projects/4). Or you can implement features that you think should be included. We would love to see what you addðŸŒŸ.

- Add confetti effects when a countdown elapses. Current version 3 only plays sound
- Adding a history page so users can set a memory to remember and view how long it has been since then. This page will also allow that elapsed countdowns show the time since they elapsed

Also, view the [dev process](/docs/dev-process.md) for inspiration by looking at the history of the application and the current direction of the project.
